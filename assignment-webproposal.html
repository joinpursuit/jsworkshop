    <h1>Assignment: Web Application Proposal</h1>

    <p>
      As part of this workshop, you will create and present a proposal for a web app you would
      like to build.  A web app is a computer program that runs within a web browser such as Chrome,
      and uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to respond to users.  In developing this proposal, you will
      try your hand at product design, which is a part of the Access Code program.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will develop the proposal in two stages.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Concept Statement</b> &mdash; individual homework</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          As a homework assignment due at the start of Day 2, you will choose a problem that you are passionate
          about, research ideas for how you might address this problem with a web app, and write up
          a Concept Statement.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Proposal</b> &mdash; team project</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          During Day 2 of the workshop, you will work in a team to develop a complete proposal.  Each
          team will consider the Concept Statements of its members and choose one, then work together
          to develop it into a Proposal.
        </p>

    <h2>Concept Statement (individual)</h2>
    <p>
      The Concept Statement is assigned during Day 1 of the workshop and due at the beginning of
      Day 2.
    </p>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Think of a problem that is personally important to you.  It may be
      a problem you've experienced yourself, or that affects a community you're part of, or that relates
      to a hobby, interest, cause, or passion important to you.  Then think about how a web
      app could address the problem.  The problem does not need to be deeply profound (you don't have to
      cure cancer!), but choose one that you are passionate about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've chosen a problem, research existing solutions to the problem, particularly web sites,
      web apps, and mobile apps that might already address it.  Think about what works well about these,
      and what doesn't work as well.  Then think about how <em>you</em> would like to solve the
      problem using a web app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your Concept Statement should include at least these sections:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The name of your Concept Statement, and your name.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A <em>Problem Statement</em>, providing context and explaining in detail what the problem is.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A summary of <em>Existing Solutions</em> to the problem, which may be technological or
          otherwise.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          One or more <em>User Stories</em>.  A user story is a description of <em>who</em> a user of the app
          might be, <em>why</em> s/he is using the app, and <em>how</em> s/he interacts with it to meet his/her
          goals. The user could be someone you know, or an imaginary typical user.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A <em>Concept</em> for the web app, explaining its major features and how they work together
          to address the problem better than the existing solutions.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Feel free to add additional sections to your Concept Statements to represent additional insights
      and ideas you might have.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dURnRGL-3pOsRQFseVBLabU7AUkCYg_jBlTaLHJf2ds/edit?usp=sharing">A
      sample Concept Statement is here.</a>  Your Concept Statement does not need to look exactly like the sample, but
      make sure you include the sections above.
    </p>

    <h4>Deliverables</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Email a PDF of your Concept Statement to
          <a href="mailto:accesscode@c4q.nyc">accesscode@c4q.nyc</a> by 10 AM on Day 2.</b>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Plan to present your Concent Statement to your team. You will have about <em>5 minutes</em> to present
          and discuss it. Focus on your problem statement and user stories.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Be ready to hear, evaluate, and improve your team members' Concept Statements.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Proposal (team)</h2>
    <p>
      You will work on the Proposal as part of a team during Day 2 of the workshop.  Each team
      will submit one proposal.
    </p>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      The Proposal should include the following sections.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The name of the Proposal and the names of team members.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <em>Problem Statement</em>, <em>Existing Solutions</em>, and <em>User Stories</em>.
          The team may choose to improve these sections from the original Concept Statement.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Features &amp; Interactivity</em>, which describes features of the app, and all the ways
          a user can interact with it.  Remember that a web app is not just a static web page with
          fixed text and pictures; a web app responds to user inputs and actions with sophisticated behaviors.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Mockups</em> of the pages. A mockup is a rough sketch of what the page looks like.</p></li>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Feel free to include any additional material you feel improves the proposal.
    </p>

    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dij2ga1rBlCrMLrGu7Lv5u0Ih35SchG74rBUoto30vo/edit?usp=sharing">A
      sample Proposal is here.</a>
      Your Proposal does not need to look exactly like the sample, but
      make sure you include the sections above.
    </p>

    <h4>Process</h4>
    <p>
      During the teamwork part of Day 2, each team will follow this process to develop the Proposal.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          (30 min) Each member of the team presents his/her Concept Statement to other members of the
          team.  Team members ask questions to clarify the  m and the proposed solution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          (10 min) The team as a whole chooses one Concept Statement to develop into a web app Proposal.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          (20 min) The team works together to refine the problem statement and user story, and to
          choose the features that will be part of the web app Proposal.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          (90 min) The team works to develop and write up the Proposal.  The team may work
          together or in subteams.  (Please do not work individually.)  It is up to each team to
          organize the work requried to create the Proposal.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      One member of each team should email a PDF of the Proposal to <a href="mailto:accesscode@c4q.nyc">accesscode@c4q.nyc</a>
      at the end of the team session.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <p>
      Please use any tools you find useful.  The web provides many free tools you can use.  For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google Docs is a great way to prepare the Concept Statement and Proposal documents, including text and pictures.
      There's a convenient "Download as PDF" feature which you can use to submit your Proposal.</li>
      <li>Many drawing, sketching, and image editing apps can be helpful in making sketches.</li>
      <li>Google Image Search can help you find images to incorporate in your designs.</li>
      <li>There are several free tools available especially for creating mockups of web and mobile apps.</li>
      <li>Some online web design tools (for example, <a href="balsamiq.com">balsamiq</a>) have free trials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      Your Concept Statement and Proposal will be evaluated on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How thoroughly did you think through your the problem, user stories, design, and features?</li>
      <li>How thoroughly did you research existing solutions?</li>
      <li>Did you prepare a carefully-written writeup?</li>
      <li>How creative is your solution to the problem?</li>
      <li>Did you search for, find, and use online resources and tools to improve your proposal?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Proposals will <em>not</em> be evaluated on aesthetics, nor on specifics of the problem you choose to address.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further, your teamwork will be evaluated on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you present your Concept Statement clearly to your team?</li>
      <li>Do you work effectively as part of a team?</li>
      <li>Do you teach and learn from your teammates?</li>
      <li>Are you respectful of your teammates?</li>
      <li>Do listen carefully to your teammates?</li>
      <li>Do you provide constructive suggestions and accept your teammates' suggestions?</li>
    </ul>
