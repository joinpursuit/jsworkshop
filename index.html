    <h1>Welcome to Access Code 3.X - 2016 JavaScript Workshop</h1>

    <h2>What is this thing?</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Access Code 2016 JavaScript workshop! In this workshop we'll be teaching you the basics of JavaScript and some of the fundamentals of programming. During this class you'll learn about expressions, variables, Arrays, Loops, Conditionals, and Functions, and use these concepts to write your own programs!
    </p>

    <h2>Game Plan</h2>
    <p>
      This workshop also serves as part of the Access Code application process. After this workshop, you'll be given an assessment containing questions about reading and writing JavaScript. The assessment will test your understanding of what you will learn during the workshop, as well as your ability and initiative to teach yourself new concepts in a short period of time. We'll look at the assessment as part of your application.
    </p>

    <h2>Environment</h2>
    <p>
      We will all be using the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html">Google Chrome browser</a>. Make sure you are on the latest version.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be using <a href="http://codepen.io/pen/">CodePen</a> to write and run small JavaScript programs. Please close the HTML and CSS boxes by clicking on the 'X' in the top right of each box.  Click on the 'console' button in the bottom left to expand the console. In the JavaScript tab we will put our code, and in the Console tab press <code>Cmd+Shift+5</code> to execute your code and see the output, and press the clear button to clear the console.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recommend downloading <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> and copying your code out of CodePen into Sublime text to keep track of all the code you've written over the course of this workshop. We will occassionally refer back to code from earlier sections later on in the course, so having that code handy will be very valuable. I personally like to create a <code>~/code/</code> folder (next to your Documents folder for example) and save all my code in there.
    </p>

    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>
      Some incredibly good JavaScript resources are available at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a>; Specifically the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js">JavaScript Tutorial</a> for explanations about the language and the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref">JavaScript Reference</a> for a comprehensive guide to the fundamental tools, libraries, and built-in objects and types of the language.
    </p>
